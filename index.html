    <!-- ABSTRACT -->
    <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <div class="section">
        Computer science (CS) education has become a popular choice for students with different native languages and yet most computer programming languages, course materials, and educational environments continue to be based on the English language. This paper identifies challenges faced by non-native English speakers (NNES) related to studying computer science through an analysis of several studies concerning programming transfer, documentation comprehension, terminology knowledge, and cognitive load; the results indicate NNES experience difficulties with understanding programming concepts, interpreting error messages, and transitioning to text-based programming due to limitations with their English language skills, lack of familiarity with technical terminology, and dependency of the programming languages syntax on English. Additionally, this paper uses a table from a multi-case study conducted by Alaofi (2025) to identify the most common English language problems. The final portion of this paper provides suggestions for improving teaching methods and course materials to assist in reducing inequities and increasing participation in computing by a broader audience.

    <!-- MAIN TEXT -->
    <div id="Introduction_InText">

        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <div class="section">
            English has become an increasingly dominant programming language globally, despite the rapid development of education of computing around the world (Guo, 2018). To non-English native speaker (NNES) students, this is a huge barrier. Beyond basic syntax and logical thinking, NNES have to interpret unfamiliar terms, follow English language instruction in class and be able to understand the error message written for English native speakers (Becker, 2019). Programming languages are embedded with English grammar and vocabulary, thus, the ability to speak English will significantly affect the student's ability to succeed in introductory courses (Becker, 2019). CS1 classes typically assume English fluency for students regardless of whether English is used in daily educational settings (Alaofi, 2025). Understanding these difficulties is critical for developing an inclusive education model for CS.

        <h3 id="language-hurdles">Language Hurdles in Learning Programming</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="sub-heading">1.1 Structure and Terms Specific to the Language</div>
            Programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ include English specific words and phrases such as "if", "else" and "return" that do not translate meaningfully into other languages (Becker, 2019). Guo (2018) identified that NNES face challenges related to reading instructional material and programming elements including identifiers and abbreviations. Alaofi (2025) noted that a lack of knowledge regarding common computer terminology was highly correlated with poor CS1 performance. Prather et al. (2017) demonstrated that learners utilize natural language reasoning when reading code, and that NNES have less effective reasoning than English native speakers.

        <div class="section">
            <div class="sub-heading">1.2 Increased Cognitive Overload</div>
            The additional mental burden of having to overcome linguistic barriers adds to the cognitive overload experienced by NNES while solving logical programming problems (Espinal et al., 2023). Translating code into a student's native language uses up the working memory needed to solve programming problems (Lye & Koh, 2014, as referenced in Espinal et al., 2023). Also, the fear of asking questions incorrectly due to not being proficient causes NNES to refrain from seeking help. Espinal et al. (2023) documented how NNES students were unable to effectively describe code based on English structures and expressions during their transition from Scratch to Python. Therefore, transitioning from visual programming to text-based programming increases the difficulties associated with language related barriers and lowers the confidence of NNES students.

        <div class="section">
            <div class="sub-heading">1.3 Barriers to Class Communication</div>
            Alaofi (2025) conducted a multi-case study of students attending English-medium CS1 classes in China and Saudi Arabia and found that students had difficulty asking questions in class due to their fears of not using proper English resulting in reduced opportunities for assistance and increased disengagement. Similarly, Guo (2018) noted that students were hesitant to engage in online discussion forums to seek peer assistance and advice due to the fear of misinterpreting technical English or using incorrect terminology.
        </div>

        <h3 id="reported-barriers">Reported English-Related Barriers Affecting CS1 Learning</h3>

        <div class="section">
            Alaofi (2025) conducted a study involving over 300 students from China and Saudi Arabia to identify how English proficiency, terminology knowledge, and anxiety affect CS1 performance. Results from the Chinese case study (Table 1 and Figure 1) identified four primary English-related barriers.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            According to Table 1, 50% of students encountered difficulty reading English, 27% of students encountered difficulty with CS-specific vocabulary, 23% of students encountered difficulty understanding programming concepts presented in English, and 20% of students encountered difficulty translating English-based programs into their native language. Smaller percentages (13-10%) reported difficulty with English-based assignments and online materials. Figure 1 reveals that 28-30% of students encountered difficulty with English-based error messages, IDE interfaces, and help commands. Approximately 23% of students reported difficulty with programming keywords, approximately 16% of students reported difficulty coding with the English alphabet, and approximately 13% of students reported difficulty spelling. In total, the findings indicate that there are four major barriers: limited general and technical English proficiency, difficulty understanding programming concepts and terminology; difficulty interpreting English-based error messages and IDE interfaces; and difficulty applying English content in CS contexts.

        <h3 id="improving">Improving CS Education for NNES Students</h3>
        <div class="section">
            To develop and support NNES learners, there are intentional changes that can be made to both teaching and learning tools. Explicit support for terminology is necessary; terminology knowledge predicts performance in CS1 (Alaofi, 2025). Vocabulary activities, bilingual glossaries, simplified definitions or inline dictionaries in coding environments to help to interpret error messages and documentation, may provide an instructor with ways to help students understand terminology (Guo, 2018). The instructor can also reduce the cognitive load of students by using visual or block-based tools, bilingual comments, and paired natural language-code examples to facilitate the transition from a graphical interface to a text-based interface in programming (Espinal et al., 2023). Finally, low-stakes participation, small group discussion in the native language(s) of the learners and inclusive, translated materials will assist to engage NNES learners and to have them have equal access to computing science.
        </div>

        <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
        <div class="section">
            Language barriers have an influence on how non-native speakers (NNES) understand terms/terminology, interpret error messages, participate in class and move from oral to written programming using text-based coding. The reasons behind this are structural, i.e., due to the dominant position of English within programming communities, not due to learner's inadequacies. To provide adequate support, one needs to design learning environment taking into account dual cognitive burden of language and technology. Methods like terminology scaffolding, bilingual materials or linguistically accessible interfaces could reduce cognitive burden and improve understanding, but also classrooms where multilingualism is normalized will give NNES students confidence to ask questions when they need help. Thus, improving linguistic accessibility of computing education has a positive impact for all learners and supports development of a more inclusive global computing education.
